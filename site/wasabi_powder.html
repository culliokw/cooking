It has a light lime coloring and sharp, hot taste and aroma. Most of the wasabi powder that is sold internationally is not 100 percent wasabi, but a mixture of mustard, horseradish and color additives (due to the high cost of the root).</p><p>Wasabi powder has a long shelf life, it will retain its taste if kept in a cool and dry place.</p><p><b>How to make wasabi paste:</b> To make wasabi paste, mix 1:1 quantity of wasabi powder and water, mix well. The texture should be a bit dry. Cover wasabi and allow to sit for 15 min to allow the enzymes to work, doing this helps bring out the full flavors of the wasabi.</p></div><h2>wasabi root</h2><div class='small'><p>Wasabi, or <b>Wasabia japonica</b>, is part of the family <b>Brassicaea</b> which includes horseradish and mustard. It is primarily cultivated for its rhizome, which has a fiery, mustard-like flavor and pungent fragrance.</p><p>Wasabi is difficult to grow, which makes it expensive to buy. Wasabi is sold as a rhizome or as a dried powder. Fresh wasabi is served with a grater and served to the table right away, because it loses flavor very quickly once it's made into a paste. Fresh Wasabi root will keep, wrapped and refrigerated, for up to two weeks.</p></div><ul></ul><hr/></main><footer><a href='journey.html'>Our Journey</a><br>2022-20XX</br></footer>
