Use 6 vanilla beans per 8 ounces of alcohol. Cut your vanilla bean pods in half along their length with scissors or a knife, put the sliced beans in a jar and cover with alcohol. If beans are too tall, cut in half. Put a lid on and shake, then store in a cool dark place (shake every week). Soak beans for at least 2 months, or more.</p></div><h2>vanilla</h2><div class='small'><p>Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). It is the second-most expensive spice after saffron because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive. Despite the expense, vanilla is highly valued for its flavor. Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally: <b>V. planifolia</b> (being the most common), <b>V. tahitensis</b> and <b>V. pompona</b>. In addition to varieties, there are also different grades of vanilla beans. Grade A beans are longer and more moist, and Grade B beans are less pretty and usually recommended for making extract. Grade B beans are less expensive.</p><p>Vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume manufacture, and aromatherapy. Natural vanilla gives a brown or yellow color to preparations, depending on the concentration.</p></div><ul></ul><hr/></main><footer><a href='journey.html'>Our Journey</a><br>2022-20XX</br></footer>
