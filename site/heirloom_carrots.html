They were commonly grown during earlier periods in human history, but are not used in modern large-scale agriculture. Many heirloom carrots kept their traits through <b>open pollination</b>, plants pollinated naturally by birds, insects, wind, or human hands.</p></div><h2>carrots</h2><div class='small'><p>Carrots contain high quantities of vitamin A. Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, <b>eastern carrots</b> (purple, yellow, often with branched roots) and <b>western carrots</b> (with an abundance of carotene). Carrots benefit from companion plants. Onions, leeks and chives for instance help repel the carrot root fly. Carrots can be stored for many months in a refrigerator, or in moist, cool places in winter. For long-term storage, carrots can be stashed in a bucket between layers of sand. A storage temperature of 0 to 5 °C is ideal.</p></div><ul></ul><hr/></main><footer><a href='journey.html'>Our Journey</a><br>2022-20XX</br></footer>
