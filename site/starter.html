The starter is a fermenting mixture of flour and water containing microorganisms which include wild yeast and lactobacilli. The yeast produces carbon dioxide which leavens the dough, and the lactobacilli produce lactic acid which contribute flavor. The process is simple, it requires more waiting than active cooking time.</p><p>To find out how to make sourdough starter, see these <a href='sourdough_starter.html'>instructions</a>.</p><p>On the illustration, is the word テキ (teki) in Japanese Katakana, which is the name of our own sourdough starter.</p></div><h2>flour</h2><div class='small'><p>Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds.
