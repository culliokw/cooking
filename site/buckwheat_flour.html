Buckwheat is not a wheat, but a 'pseudocereal' that is related to sorrel, knotweed and rhubarb. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked. Buckwheat groats have a rich, nutty flavor, and are a good source of <b>zinc</b> and of the protein <b>lysine</b>.</p><p>The groats can be processed into flour, made into beer, roasted and brewed as tea to make soba-cha <b>そば茶</b> and cooked like rice.</p><p>Weight: 1 cup | 6 oz | 170 g</p></div><ul></ul><hr/></main><footer><a href='journey.html'>Our Journey</a><br>2022-20XX</br></footer>
