The rich taste of the milk is due to its high oil content. This high-fat milk is a perfect base for <a href='hop_ice_cream.html'>ice cream</a>. There are many varieties, differentiated on fat content: coconut cream (up to 50 percent fat), coconut milk (20 percent fat) and coconut skim milk (least fat). The terminology is not always described like this in products sold in western countries. Traditionally, coconut milk is made from grating the white inner flesh of mature coconuts and mixing the shredded pulp with a bit of hot water to suspend the fat in the pulp. The grating process was often done by hand.</p></div><h2>coconut</h2><div class='small'><p>Coconuts stem from the coconut tree, or <b>Cocos nucifera</b>.
