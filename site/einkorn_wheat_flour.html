It is low-yielding, but thrives on poor, dry soil and fares better than other wheat in the same situations. Einkorn has more protein than modern red wheats, and is more nutritious. It is a good source of <b>protein</b> and <b>iron</b>.</p><p>Because Einkorn wheat doesn't have much gluten, it won't rise as well as other wheats, but can be used in a variety of recipes like cookies, chips, pasta, crusts and salads. Two popular brands include Jovial Foods (Italy) and <a href='https://www.daybreakmill.com/' target='_blank'>Daybreak Mill</a> (Canadian).</p></div><h2>flour</h2><div class='small'><p>Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds.
