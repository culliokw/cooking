Thick-rolled oats are large whole flakes, and thin-rolled oats are smaller, fragmented flakes. Rolled whole oats when further processed are broken down yet again into smaller flakes. This size helps them cook quicker. They can be cooked into a porridge. You can make your own quick oats from old-fashioned oats (rolled oats) by grinding them in a food processor.</p></div><h2>oats</h2><div class='small'><p>Oats, or <b>Avena sativa</b>, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed.
