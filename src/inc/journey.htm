<h1>Mi Amor,</h1>

<p style="width:800px;height:120px;">We have always talked about in the past both of us having the idea of having a written book to track the recipes that we try together.  Well, we will definitely get to that someday!  However, until then, I thought it would be a good start to have this site here.  An eternal, digital archive of those special meals and times that we have together with music drifting into a kitchen while we discuss life, laugh, and create lasting moments.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Any category of meal or treat that you want to add, it can be added.  Any category of special adventure we undertake together that you want to catalog, it can be added.  An online means of writing gives us practically unlimited space, and you know the funny thing?  I think by the end of it all, if I am lucky enough, we'll be able to almost hit that infinite limit.</p>
<p><u><b>Happy Valentine's Day, Babe.</b></u> I am truly blessed to be able to be a part of your life and journey.  I know I am the best version of myself now and when spending time with you.  You are a light and to say I am excited for what the future has in store, whatever that may be, would be an understatement so strong that it could warp space-time.  Excited to get to hopefully support you on your way to achieving your dreams!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I love you.<br>Forever Yours</br></p>
